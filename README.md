# Resturant System
**Version 0.0.1**  

This is a purely educational purpose project, and also let me show my work in a more realistic way within a heterogeneous tech stack.
Why a restauran system? It's easy, I love cooking.

The project aims to build a system for management and planning activities of a restaurant.

## Scope
In this version, we'll deliver the required components for designing and costing recipes.

The following diagram shows a initial blueprint:
